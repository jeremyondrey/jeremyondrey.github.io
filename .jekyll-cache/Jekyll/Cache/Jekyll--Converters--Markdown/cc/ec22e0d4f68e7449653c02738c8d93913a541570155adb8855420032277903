<p>In 2017/18, I  uploaded something to Soundcloud every week. This turned out to be the best way for me to get better at the music I make, because otherwise I'd never finish anything, ever. It forced me to waste less time and focus my workflow, and after a month I ended up with some cool samples that were created in the process as well.

<p>I stopped to focus more on full releases, but the tracks are still on Soundcloud:</p>
