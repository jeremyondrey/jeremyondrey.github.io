<p>First off: I am not a game dev and have little experience with modeling/lighting/game mechanics or anything of this nature. This project was more of an experiment testing the possibilities of spatial sound in VR. I built a small scene set on a vaporwave themed island, using Unity Engine, Oculus spatializer plugins and SketchUp (for basic models). As you move through the scene on your trusty hoverboard, you can explore different digital artworks that each have their own soundtrack.<br /> The soundtrack is available <a href="https://nokia444.bandcamp.com/"> here</a>, which I made in an evening. The game I would rather not share, because it would give you eye cancer.
