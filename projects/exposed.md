<p> EXPOSED is an interactive 3D audio installation that further drives the discussion of big data in today's society. A simple white pillar with built in microphone coils picks up electromagnetic signals from smartphones placed on it. This sound is automatically spatialized using an ambisonics speaker setup, turning the data we carry with us every day into an immersive audible experience.
