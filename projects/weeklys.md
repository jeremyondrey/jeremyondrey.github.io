<p>I upload something to Soundcloud every week. This turned out to be the best way for me to get better at the music I make, because otherwise I'd never finish anything, ever. It forces me to waste less time and focus my workflow, and after a month I end up with some cool samples that were created in the process as well.

<p>The project ahs been paused for 2017, which gives me some time to finalize a couple productions to prepare for a proper release. More infos on that will follow soon.</p>
