<p>I try to keep up a habit of uploading a track to Soundcloud every week. It forces me to waste less time and focus my workflow, and after a month i end up with some cool samples that were created in the process as well.
<br>
Here's the playlist of past uploads, starting with some really simple beats and slowly moving towards a more focused direction. </p>

<p>After a holiday break, the format is resuming, now every <i>sunday</i>. Tracks will be mostly 170 BPM centric, with some experimentation as usual. Follow the process on Souncloud:</p>
