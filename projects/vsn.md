<div align="center">
<p> The logo for audiovision is based on audioreactive visuals that we use at our events. I originally took a quick screenshot to see what it looked like printed on a sticker, discarded the idea and started completely different designs from scratch, thinking that nobody would understand what it was.
<br>
When I compared all my designs, the shape stuck out for some reason I couldn't describe. Despite its chaotic edges and assymetrical proportions, it remains recognizable, it sticks out on simple and textured backgrounds, and best of all: once you come to an event, you see it in motion. It looks odd at first glance, but invites you to take a closer look.
