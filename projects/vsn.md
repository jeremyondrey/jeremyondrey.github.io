<p> audiovsn is a music collective based in Darmstadt, DE. We organize various events with immersive 3D sound, audioreactive lights and generative visuals .

<p> The logo for audiovsn is based on audioreactive visuals that we use at our events. The idea being that you have to actually come to our events to see what it looks like in motion, since video recordings of our systems never capture the full experience :)

<br>
We had a couple design mockups, the shape was just a test render from our visual system. Turns out this worked better than every other planned design we had. The shape is instantly recognizable, it sticks out on simple and textured backgrounds, and best of all: once you come to an event, you see it in motion. It looks odd at first glance, but invites you to take a closer look.

<h1 align="left">LIGHTS</h1>
<p>
	Lights are an important part of the events we organize. We believe that most club lighting systems have too many features and put too little focus on what's important. Our approach consists of a flexible LED stripe system, which syncs with a Max/MSP/openGL projection. Our system is audioreactive, which means that when no music is playing, the room is pitch black. This works really well in a club context, because light and sound are perfectly in sync with each other.
