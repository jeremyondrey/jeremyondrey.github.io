- sound designer 
- producer
- media artist

I offer a variety of (mostly audio related) services, if you like something you see in a project of mine and want something similar, feel free to get in touch.

My main focus right now is music production - my [weekly series](/weeklys) is intended to be a showcase of my current production skills. I offer project consultation, sound design and predominantly electronic music production. 

I also teach concepts of the tools I use. Get in touch if youâ€™re around Darmstadt and want to learn music production in Ableton Live.

Max/MSP, Pure Data, vvvv and Arduino are my preferred tools for installations and hardware prototyping.

My social feed on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/lumsdnb) documents most of my artistic process, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lumsdnb) account is a bit inactive but I respond to messages. If you want to get *real serious*, contact me at **jeremy@lums.io**
